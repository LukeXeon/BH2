More than 130 high quality prefabs (walls , floors, props, computers, pre-builded corridors, rooms, and more...). 

The prefabs are allready configured with their lights/ particles/sound effects. 
With the sci fi level kit you put your prefabs on the scene, and you start calculating the lightmap. Thats all!
